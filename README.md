Note to self, how did I create this book?
- read the documentation on [jupyterbook.org](https://jupyterbook.org)
- implemented the approach "[Automatically host your book with GitHub Actions](https://jupyterbook.org/publish/gh-pages.html#automatically-host-your-book-with-github-actions)"
- modified the yaml file of the github action to also produce a pdf output ([but how do I get it back?](https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/discussions/124))

Tips:
- have a look at the [sphinx demo page](https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/demo.html) for some insight
